# hello-world
just another repository

My name is Bima, I like black, so my accounts name is Kurobima. Since I also like to watch anime & read manga from Japan ^_^

I'm looking for a way to connect Arduino to Inverter LS SV-iC5 using modbus RTU protocol. Using Arduino as a master, I hope I can change the parameter of the inverter & operate it to run a motor. If there is Anyone who can help me, I would be really happy ^_^
